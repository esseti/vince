Vince - Early is on time, on time is late and late is unacceptable!

I need an app (MAC - OSX) that shows me the meeting of todays, how much time left till the next meeting and how much time i've left in current meeting (if any)

There are such apps around but they don't really work as I would expect.

The app is written in python, and connects to google workspace. It also adds links for hangout/meet meetings. 

#### NOTE
name in honor of vince lombardi and his attitute on being on time.
Still, the quote is from someone else, but calling the app `dickie` sounded strange to me.
